Me screaming at myself

1)BUTTON GEN STUFF IS LIKE...UH....... NOT DONE
3) WE HAVE A WIN CONDITION NOW AT >=100 LITERALLY DO NOT FORGET PLS

Other perhaps iffy things:
- Currently, I am outputting the buttontype as the score. This is done so I can directly increment the score from the regfile.
  however, I may have to deal with some case logic nonsense in alchitrytop. Think of workaround? Or is this fine?
	- 0: button not lit up
	- 1: blue button
	- 5: green button
	- 20: red button
- Currently, I am also outputting button activated as a number (this number is processed by an ALU function in my states SET_ACTIVE_BUTTON)
  must also deal with the cases in alchitry_top
	- 0: no buttons
	- 1: button1
	- 2: button2
	- you get the picture
-Rebalance the timers
- Debug is literally nothing
- Resetbutton removed (check for residue)
- I'm not sure whether awake check and cooldown check should check at 0 or will that introduce more cooldown than necessary????
	- I dont think I can change this to 1 or else I risk decrementing into the negatives on startup!
	- I might rebalance the game values to take this into account that we have one tick of nothingness between the button timing out and the cooldown begin
	  AND one tick between cooldown begin and button reentering the
